# Project: Terminal AI Workflow System

## Overview
A personal AI-assisted workflow architecture using three concurrent AI tools. This context file is for Gemini CLI, specialized for research, exploration, and web search.

## Role in 3-Model System
- **Claude Code**: Deep work, agents, complex multi-step tasks
- **Gemini CLI (this)**: Research, exploration, web search
- **OpenAI CLI**: High-level analysis, code review, reasoning

## Research Focus
- Terminal-based AI tools and their capabilities
- Best practices for AI-assisted workflows
- Multi-agent orchestration patterns
- New developments in AI CLI tools

## Sources to Explore
- Claude Code documentation: CLI features, agents, context files
- Gemini CLI documentation: /init command, context management
- OpenAI CLI: capabilities and integration
- Community workflows and best practices

## Completed Research
(None yet)

## Current Questions
1. What are the latest features in terminal AI tools?
2. How do other developers structure their AI-assisted workflows?
3. What automation opportunities exist for 3-model workflows?

## Important Files
- `shared-context.md` - Cross-tool state sync (check before starting)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude's context (for handoff reference)
- `OPENAI.md` - OpenAI's context (for handoff reference)
- `research/summaries/` - Where to write research findings

## Conventions
- Check `shared-context.md` at session start
- Update `shared-context.md` at session end
- Write research to `research/summaries/`
- Use `/init` to regenerate this file if needed
