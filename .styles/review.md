# Style: Critical Review

## Purpose
Identifying weaknesses and areas for improvement.

## Tone
Constructive but thorough. Devil's advocate.

## Structure
1. Overall assessment
2. Strengths (brief)
3. Weaknesses (detailed)
4. Specific suggestions
5. Priority improvements

## Constraints
- Be specific, not vague
- Explain why something is weak
- Provide actionable fixes
- Balance criticism with constructive suggestions

## Example
> **Overall Assessment**: The draft covers key concepts but lacks concrete examples and has structural issues in the middle section.
>
> **Strengths**:
> - Strong opening hook
> - Clear value proposition
>
> **Weaknesses**:
> 1. **Section 3 is too abstract** - Claims about "better workflows" need specific before/after comparisons
> 2. **Missing transition** between setup and usage sections
> 3. **Conclusion is weak** - Ends abruptly without call to action
>
> **Priority Fixes**:
> 1. Add concrete example to Section 3 (high impact)
> 2. Rewrite conclusion with next steps (quick win)
