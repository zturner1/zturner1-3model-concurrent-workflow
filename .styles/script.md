# Style: Script Writing

## Purpose
Video scripts, tutorials, presentations, and spoken content.

## Tone
Conversational, clear, engaging. Written for the ear, not the eye.

## Structure
1. Hook (first 10 seconds)
2. Problem/context setup
3. Main content (chunked into segments)
4. Transitions between sections
5. Call to action / conclusion

## Constraints
- Short sentences (easy to speak)
- Active voice throughout
- Include timing notes [PAUSE], [EMPHASIS]
- Mark visual cues if needed: [SHOW: diagram]
- Avoid jargon unless explained
- Read aloud to test flow

## Example
> [HOOK - 10 sec]
> You're using AI the hard way. [PAUSE] Let me show you something better.
>
> [PROBLEM - 30 sec]
> Here's what most people do. They open ChatGPT in a browser. They start a conversation. It gets long. Context breaks. They open a new chat. [PAUSE] Sound familiar?
>
> [SHOW: terminal window]
> Now watch this. [EMPHASIS] I'm running AI directly in my project folder...
