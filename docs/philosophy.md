# You've Been Using AI the Hard Way - Use the Terminal Instead

If you're still using AI exclusively in a browser tab, you're doing it the slow way.

Most people don't realize this, but nearly every major AI tool now has a terminal version - and once you experience it, going back to the browser feels like working with one hand tied behind your back.

This isn't just about writing code. Terminal-based AI fundamentally changes how you research, write, plan projects, and manage context. It gives you control. And that control compounds.

## The Browser Workflow Is Broken

If this sounds familiar, you're not alone:

- You start a project in ChatGPT or another AI app.
- The conversation gets long. The scrollbar disappears.
- Context starts breaking.
- You open new chats "just to be safe."
- You cross-check answers in Claude, Gemini, maybe another tool.
- You copy-paste snippets into a notes app.
- Eventually everything is scattered.

At that point, your project isn't a project anymore. It's fragments spread across chats, tabs, and half-finished documents.

The problem isn't the AI.  
The problem is the interface.

---

## The Terminal Is the Missing Piece

AI in the terminal solves this by doing one critical thing the browser can't:

**It lives inside your project.**

When you run AI tools from a terminal:

- They operate directly inside a folder on your machine
- They can read and write files
- They persist context between sessions
- They don't trap your work in a chat window

Instead of *talking about* your project, the AI becomes part of it.

## Starting Simple: Gemini CLI

Gemini CLI is a great entry point because it has a generous free tier and installs with a single command.

Once installed, you create a project directory and launch Gemini from inside it. Immediately, you'll notice something different:

- The terminal shows your remaining context window
- You can ask Gemini to research topics and write files directly
- You can generate documents, outlines, and plans without copy-paste

For example, you can ask Gemini to:

- Research a topic
- Compile reputable sources
- Write results into a Markdown file
- Create a structured blog outline

And it will do exactly that - directly into your project folder.

---

## Context Files Change Everything

The real magic starts when you initialize a project context file.

Running `/init` in Gemini creates a `GEMINI.md` file. This file becomes persistent memory for your project. It contains:

- What the project is about
- Key decisions
- Relevant files
- Current status

Every time you reopen Gemini in that folder, it automatically loads this context.

That means:

- No re-explaining the project
- No lost threads
- No "remind me what we were doing"

You own your context. It lives on your hard drive.

---

## Claude Code: The Daily Driver

Claude Code takes this idea even further.

Like Gemini, it runs in the terminal and supports project context files (`CLAUDE.md`). But Claude introduces something that changes how large projects scale.

### Agents

Agents are specialized sub-AIs you can delegate tasks to.

Instead of bloating a single conversation, you can:

- Create agents with specific roles
- Give them fresh context windows
- Let them research, critique, or generate content independently

Your main conversation stays clean and focused while agents do the heavy lifting.

This eliminates one of the biggest problems with AI workflows: context overload.

---

## Multi-Agent Workflows

With agents, you can:

- Have one agent research hardware
- Another analyze an outline
- Another critique your work
- Another search the web using a different model

All simultaneously.  
All inside the same project folder.  
All writing to files you own.

Each agent gets a fresh context window, so nothing interferes with anything else.

This feels less like chatting with AI and more like managing a small team.

---

## Output Styles: Tuning the AI to You

Claude Code also supports **output styles**, which are customizable system prompts.

You can define:

- Writing style
- Tone
- Depth
- Purpose

Then switch styles depending on what you're doing:

- Script writing
- Technical planning
- Critical review
- Research synthesis

Instead of rewriting prompts constantly, you select the role and move on.

---

## Using Multiple AI Tools Together

You can run multiple AI tools in the same project directory.

For example:

- Claude for deep work
- Gemini for research
- Codex CLI for high-level analysis

As long as they share the same folder and synced context files, they all see the same project state.

No copy-paste.  
No vendor lock-in.  
No lost work.

Your project becomes tool-agnostic.

---

## You Own Your Work

Everything lives in files:

- Scripts
- Notes
- Context
- Decisions
- History

This means:

- You can version it with Git
- You can back it up
- You can move it anywhere
- You can switch AI providers at any time

The AI is no longer the container.  
Your filesystem is.

---

## Why This Feels Like a Superpower

Terminal-based AI:

- Removes friction
- Preserves context
- Scales to large projects
- Encourages structure
- Makes AI collaborative instead of conversational

Once you experience this workflow, browser-based AI starts to feel primitive.

---

## Final Thought

This isn't about abandoning GUIs forever.  
It's about control.

When AI works *inside* your projects instead of around them, you stop fighting the tool and start building with it.

Try it once.  
You won't go back.
